  <h2>Rome 4:17-19</h2>
  <p>
17 As it is written: 'I have made you a father of many nations.'<br>
He is our father in the sight of God,<br>
in whom he believed-the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were.</p>
<p>18 Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations,<br>
just as it had been said to him, "So shall your offspring be."</p>
<p>19 Without weakening in his faith,<br>
he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead-since he was about a hundred years old-and that Sarah's womb was also dead.</p>
