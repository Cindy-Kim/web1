  Listen to me, you islands; hear this, you distant nations:
  Before I was born the LORD called me;
  <u>from my birth</u> <strong>he has made mention of my name</strong>.
  <p style="margin-top:15px;">He made my mouth like a sharpened sword,
  in the shadow of his hand he hid me;<br> he made me into a polished
  arrow and concealed me in his quiver.</p>
  <p>He said to me,
  "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will display my splendor.'</p>
  <p>But I said, "I have labored to no purpose;<br>
  I have spent my strength in vain and for nothing.<br>
  Yet what is due me is in the LORD's hand, and my reward is with my God."</p>
